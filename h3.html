            <p>Before Microsoft became a success in the 1980s, co-founder Bill Gates struggled with self-confidence and actually feared that his business would be a bust, he told students during a Q&A at Harvard last month.<strong> “Even the idea that Microsoft would be a big company, I never would admit that to myself,” </strong>Gates said.</p>
